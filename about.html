<h3>Alpha 18 Cars a private hire car service </h3>
<br>
  <p> 
Alpha 18 Cars provides its services for passengers in central Mid-Sussex and regards the A272 and A275 corridors as “our patch”. 
We have two main operating areas. First is in  Haywards Heath stretching to 
Scanes Hill, Chailey, Newick, Cooksbridge, Maresfield and Piltdown. 
The second area is East Grinstead, incluting Ashurst Wood, Forest Row, Horsted Keynes, Sharpthone, 
Wych Cross, Danehill, Sheffield Park, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Alpha 18 Cars was founded about twenty years ago by Bob Massey and his wife Jeanette. 
In 2014 Daniel Stangar joined their family enterprise and on March 2018 became its new owner.</p>

<br>
<h4>Qualifications</h4>
<p>Our personal fleet of fully insured vehicles includes large hi-spec saloons and estate cars.
Alpha 18 Cars are licensed by the council, and by strict regulation we are regularly medically and CRB policed checked. 
We all hold current certificates.</p>

<br>
<h4>Airports, Railports, Sea Ports And Cruise Terminals</h4>

<p>This is where Alpha 18 really excels. We have many years of experience traveling 
to and from many UK Cruise Terminals, Air, Rail, and Seaports, including Gatwick and Heathrow. 
Over the years we have gained intimate knowledge of the layout and systems in place 
and use this expertise to give you an excellent quality of service.</p>

<br>
<h4>Business Travellers</h4>
<p>We are very proud of our business client portfolio and 
a common link to the passenger is often via a very efficient secretary/pa. 
Some of our business customers who travel frequently enjoy the convenience of a monthly account. 
Others use a business credit card and pay as they go. We have contacless card payment devices in every car.
After a long haul flight, some clients contact us while negotiating passport control and baggage reclaim 
to request coffee/water and a newspaper to be met with in arrivals.</p>

<br>
<h4>Holiday Travellers</h4>
<p>Your holiday starts the minute you get into one of our cars. The driver will “check” you have everything 
and done everything before driving off. When en route the driver may talk about your destination. 
At the point of drop off the driver will re-check any return details.</p>

<br>
<h4>Assisted Travel</h4>
<p>If you have booked assistance at the port please let us know before pick up 
as the drop off area may be different to normal. The cruise terminals have this sorted very well 
and just recently the airports have designated drop off zones. 
Generally it is usually a senior citizen who has booked assistance, and with Alpha 18 senior citizens 
enjoy set fares and a service with empathy.</p>
