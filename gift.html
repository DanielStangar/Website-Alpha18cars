<h1> Something different</h1>

<p>This gift we are offering for download is a short book, novella. 
    Our friend and author Gael S. Daan asked us to give out our customers a sample of his work.</p>

<p>Gael S. Daan writes fiction in which he often talks about paranormal phenomena and this story is about people with telepathic ability. The author himself had such experiences, studied the subject of extra sensory perceptions thoroughly and knows what he is talking about. Although his novella 
would probably categorize best as a science fiction, he was able to explain the mysterious subject 
of telepathy in such a way that even a ten years old can understand it. That makes it even more interesting.</p>
<p>You won't be asked for your email or any other contact details while downloading the novella. You will just get the book. If your device can open a pdf file, you may be able to read it straight away.
